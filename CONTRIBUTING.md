# Learn By Coding

## How to contribute:

### Adding a lab:
1. Make an issue on the github page.
2. Explain what the lab adds to the content that isn't there already. 
3. If your request to add that lab is deemed a good idea by the maintainers and the community. Start the write up of the lab. Make sure you use one of the current labs as a template. (We will not merge lab writeups that do not follow the same design)
4. Do a pull request on the code with the lab.

### Adding an assignment:
1. Make an issue on the github page.
2. Explain what the assignment adds to the content that isn't there already. 
3. If your request to add that assignment is deemed a good idea by the maintainers and the community. Start the write up of the assignment. Make sure you use one of the current labs as a template. (We will not merge lab writeups that do not follow the same design)
4. Do a pull request on the code with the lab.

### Adding a lesson:
1. Make an issue on the github page.
2. Explain what the lesson adds that isn't covered by the previous lessons.
3. If the request is met with a positive response. We will contact you personally and invite you to join the team of maintainers. 
4. By proposing a lesson we expect you to create all the labs and assignments for that lesson.

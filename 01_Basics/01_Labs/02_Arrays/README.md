# Learn By Cloning
## Lesson: Basics
## Lab: 02

### Goal:
- Learn what an `array` is. 
- Learn what an element of an `array` is.
- Learn what an `index` of an `array` is.
- Learn what the syntax of an `array` is.
- Learn how to create & access an `array`.
- Learn about the limitations of `arrays`.

### What you need to do:
- Understand that an array is an ordered grouping of elements of a given type.
- Research how to write and access an array.
- Write some code initializing an `integer array` of size 20.
- Write a loop to initialize all the elements in the array with a number (bonus: Initialize it with a random number).
- Write another loop to find the average of the numbers inside the array (Research what a for-each loop is and use that).
- Optional: How would you add a 21st element to the array?

### Conclusion:
- You should know that you can make an `array` of all data types in Java.
- You should know how to access individual elements inside the `array`.
- You should know what the limitations of `arrays` are.

### Quick Quiz:
- Do arrays have a limit in how big they can get? What is that limit?
- What are some issues with arrays? (Come back to this question in future lessons, what has been added to this list?)

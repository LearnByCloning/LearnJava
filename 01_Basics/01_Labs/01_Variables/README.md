## Lesson: Basics
## Lab: 01

### Goal:
- Understand Java's primitive types.
- Understand what a `String` is and to create one.
- Understand how variables are declared, assigned, and accessed.
- Understand what the different scopes are in Java.

### What you need to do:
- Research what types of variables there are in Java.
- Research what type of data each variable in Java represents.
- Research what scope means in the context of variables.
- (Bonus) Find out how to use comments in Java.

### Conclusion:
- You should be able to assign data to variables and print that data out using the variable.

### Quick Quiz:
- Where would you choose to use a `float` rather than an `int`?
- Where would you choose to use a `long` rather than an `int`?
- What are the maximum and minimum values that you can give to `byte`s, `short`s, `int`s and `long`s?
    - How many bytes of memory are used? (You don't need to memorize this one. Just know which is bigger)
- Where would you choose to use a `double` rather than a `float`?
- How is the data inside the variable stored inside memory?
- (Bonus) What is the difference between `Integer` and `int`?

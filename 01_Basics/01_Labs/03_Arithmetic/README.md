### Goal:
- Understand Java's mathematical operators
- Understand Java's relational operators
- Understand Java's logical operators
- Understand Java's assignment operators
- (Bonus) Understand Java's bitwise operators

### What you need to do:
- Research the different operators available in Java
- Research the order of operation of Java operators
- (Bonus) Research bitwise operators
- (Bonus) Research two's complement

### Conclusion:
- You should understand now how the different operators work, and what they do.

### Quick Quiz:
- What is the difference between mathematical operators and relational operators?
- Why do bitwise operators only work on `byte`s, `short`s, `int`s, and `long`s?

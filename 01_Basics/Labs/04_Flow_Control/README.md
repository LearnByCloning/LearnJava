## Lesson: Basics
## Lab: 04

### Goal:
- Understand how to use `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- Understand how to use `if`, `else-if`, and `else` statements and decide which direction the code should go.
- Understand how to use `switch` and `case`.

### What you need to do:
- Research the syntax of a `for` loop.
- Use a `for` loop to add a range of numbers starting from 1 (Hint: You can use `Sum from 1 to n = n(n + 1)/2` to check your work).
- Research the syntax of a `while` and `do-while` loop.
- Use a `while` loop to add a range of numbers starting from 1.
- Use a `do-while` loop to add a range of numbers starting from 1.
- Research the syntaxes of a `if` `else-if` and `else` statements.
- Obtain user input for age, using `if` statements decide based upon the age what the person can see.
- Research the syntax of `switch` statements.
- Obtain user input for age, using `switch` statements decide based upon the age what the person can see.

### Conclusion:
- You can effectively use loops instead of repeating code.


### Quiz:
- What is the order of execution for the statements inside the `for` loop?
- What is the difference of a `while` and `do-while` loop?
- What happens if you don't use `break` inside the switch cases?
- How many `else-if` statements can you have? What happens when the code enters one of the `if` statements?

## Lesson: Basics
## Lab: 01

### Goal:
- Understand Java's native variables.
- Understand how information gets assigned to them and how they are used.
- Understand how they are named.
- Understand what scope is.

### What you need to do:
- Research what types of variables there are in Java.
- Research what type of data each variable in Java represents.
- Research what scope means in the context of variables.
- (Bonus) Find out how to use comments in Java.

### Conclusion:
- You should be able to assign data to variables and print that data out using the variable.

### Quick Quiz:
- Where would you choose to use a `float` rather than an `integer`?
- Where would you choose to use a `long` rather than an `int`?
- What are the maximum and minimum values that you can give to `byte`s, `short`s, `int`s and `long`s? How many bytes of memory are used?
- Where would you choose to use a `double` rather than a `float`?
- How is the data inside the variable stored inside memory?

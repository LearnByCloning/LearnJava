### Quick Quiz:
> What is the difference between mathematical operators and relational operators?

What do mathematical operators return?
What do relational operators return?

> Why do bitwise operators only work on `byte`s, `short`s, `int`s, and `long`s?

What is in common with `float`s and `double`s?

> What does `1.0 * 2` give?
What does `1 / 2` give? Why?
What does `1.0 / 2.0` give? Why?
What does `1 / 0` give? Why?
What does `1.0 / 0.0` give? Why?
What does `2 % 2` give?

The easiest thing to do here is to guess the answer and test out the code.
Test one command at a time though, so you can learn what the answer should be.

> What does `true && true` give?
What does `true && false` give?
What does `false && false` give?

The `&&` operator is the `AND` operator. What does that mean?

> What does `true || true` give?
What does `true || false` give?
What does `false || false` give?

The `||` operator is the `OR` operator. What does that mean?

> What does `!true` give?
What does `!false` give?

The `!` operator is the `NOT` operator. What does that mean?

> What does `1 & 1` give?
What does `2 & 1` give?
What does `3 & 1` give?
What does `1 | 1` give?
What does `2 | 1` give?
What does `3 | 1` give?
What does `1 ^ 1` give?
What does `2 ^ 1` give?
What does `3 ^ 1` give?

What are the binary representations of `1`, `2`, and `3`?
What do the operators do?

> What does `~0` give? Why?

Since Java uses two's complement, and `0`'s binary represenation is `00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000`, what is `11111111 11111111 11111111 11111111` in two's complement?

> What does `1 << 2` give? Why?
What does `4 >> 2` give? Why?
What does `~0 >>> 31` give? Why?

What are the binary representations of `1`, `4`, and `~0`?
What do the operators do?

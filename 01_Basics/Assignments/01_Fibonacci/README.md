## Assignment: 01

### Goal:
- Print a certain amount of values from the Fibonacci sequence.

### What you need to do:
- Obtain a number from the user input and call it `n`.
- Check if the number is negative or zero. If so tell the user their input was bad and ask them for their input again. (Try this with both `while` and `do-while`).
- Once a correct input has been entered, start printing out that many values from the Fibonacci sequence.

### Conclusion:
Your program can look like this:

> How many numbers do you want to print?

-5

> That is an invalid amount. 

> How many numbers do you want to print?

0

> That is an invalid amount.

> How many numbers do you want to print?

8
> Here are your numbers: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

### Quiz:
- Which one was a better loop choice? `do-while` or `while`? Why?
- (Bonus) (Look ahead) How would you make sure a `String` is actually a number?

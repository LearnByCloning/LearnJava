## Assignment: 01

### Goal:
- Create a simple calculator application to perform either `+`, `-`, `/` or `*` on two numbers.

### What you need to do:
- Prompt the user to provide the type of calculation to perform (addition, subtraction, division or multiplication) and store this in a variable.
- Prompt the user to input the first number, followed by the second number.
    - The calculator should work with both decimals (``double``s) or whole numbers (``int``s). 
    - What variable type do we need to achieve this?
- Print the result of the calculation.

### Conclusion:
Your program can look like this:

```
What type of calculation would you like to perform (+, -, / or *): 
```
X

```
That is an invalid selection.
What type of calculation would you like to perform (+, -, / or *): 
```
*

```
Please enter the first number: 
```
5

```
Please enter the second number:
```
3.7

```
5 * 3.7 = 18.5
```

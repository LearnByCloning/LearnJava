# LearnJava

Hello and welcome to LearnJava! 

LearnJava is a unique programming course like no other. This course focuses on assisted guidance learning instead of teach, copy and learn methods.

The course structure consists of lessons, labs and assignments. Lessons are categorized topics (e.g. Getting Started, Basics and Object Oriented Programming). Labs will provide you with guiding topics and an introduction to a new concept. Assignments allow you to test your knowledge to create a program according to the definition. 

Currently this course is being developed our [contributors](https://github.com/LearnByCloning/LearnJava/graphs/contributors). We plan to cover all topics from introductory to advanced system implementations.

We hope you find this course helpful, and appreciate all feedback.

# LearnJava

Hello and welcome to LearnJava! 

Each of these assignments will explore a certain aspect of computing and the java programming language. There will be assignments ranging from simple mathematics to file manipulation and socket programming all the way to full on OOP design protocols. There will also be bonus assignments dealing with the language itself and will teach you how to use reflection and native calls within Java.

Remember this is a self directed learning system. So you will need to be able to use the internet (mostly stackoverflow) to be able to write the programs for each assignment. 

I recommend you use IntelliJ programming the assignments. However you can use any other IDE that has Maven integration. Or you can forgo IDEs all together and use simple text editor (vim) and complete the code there.

After the assignments, we're going to have some fun projects to do. We will write programs dealing with REST APIs and programs dealing with Bukkit/Spigot/Sponge. These will provide _real_ experiences in using the programming language.

## Lesson: Introduction
## Assignment: 01

### Goal:
- Make the skeleton code print out "hello world!".

### What you need to do:
- Figure out how to print stuff in java. (Seriously just google that).
- Run the code in three ways:
    - Make it run inside the IDE of your choosing (skip this if you decided to use a text editor).
    - Use javac to compile the code into a class file and run it.
    - Use maven to compile the code. Run the jar file. Figure out the issue with compiling it. (I've left you a hint in the pom.xml file of where you need to change)

### Conclusion:
- You print out hello world!
